      The anime franchise consists of seven sequential series in Japan, each
      based on a main installment of the Pok√©mon video game series. In the
      international broadcasts, these series are split across 24 television
      seasons, with the 24th season, Master Journeys, streaming on Netflix in
      the United States (with additional episodes to be released quarterly).
      Each of the series follows Ash Ketchum, a young trainer of fictional
      creatures called Pok√©mon. Joined by his partner Pok√©mon Pikachu and a
      rotating cast of human characters, currently Goh, Ash goes on a journey to
      become a "Pok√©mon Master", travelling through the various regions of the
      Pok√©mon world and competing in various Pok√©mon-battling tournaments known
      as the Pok√©mon League. <br />
      The Pok√©mon anime series was largely credited for allowing anime to become
      more popular and familiar around the world, especially in the United
      States, where the two highest-grossing anime films are both Pok√©mon films.
      It is also considered to be one of the first anime series on television to
      reach this level of mainstream success with Western audiences, as well as
      being credited with allowing the game series to reach such a degree of
      popularity and vice versa. Pok√©mon is regarded as the most successful
      video game adaptation of all time,[4] with over 1000 episodes broadcast
      and adapted for international television markets, concurrently airing in
      192 countries worldwide and one of the most widely watched shows on
      Netflix, as of 2016.

      <p>
        Ash Ketchum is 10 years old and ready to start his journey in the world
        of Pok√©mon and dreams of becoming a Pok√©mon master, but on the day he is
        to receive his first Pok√©mon, Ash oversleeps and wakes up in a panic,
        running into Gary Oak, who becomes Ash's rival. Professor Oak, the local
        Pok√©mon researcher, has already given away the three Pok√©mon (Bulbasaur,
        Charmander, and Squirtle) he entrusts to new Pok√©mon Trainers when Ash
        finally reaches Oak's Lab. The only Pok√©mon that he has left is a
        Pikachu, which he gives to Ash. Determined to make it on his journey,
        Ash does his best to befriend Pikachu, but it refuses to trust him and
        chooses to stay out of the Pok√© Ball, even attacking Ash with its
        electric powers. It is only after Ash protects Pikachu from an angry
        group of Spearows that Pikachu realizes how much Ash cares. Ash Ketchum
        has the Thunder Stone, and he wants Pikachu to evolve into Raichu, but
        Pikachu refuses to evolve.
        <br />
        Along the way, Ash makes many human and Pok√©mon friends as he works his
        way through the ranks of the world's many Pok√©mon Leagues. Through the
        Kanto Region, Ash befriends Water Pok√©mon trainer and former Cerulean
        City Gym Leader Misty, and Pok√©mon Breeder and Pewter City Gym Leader
        Brock. Together, the three trainers thwart the plans of Jessie, James,
        and Meowth, low-ranking members of the criminal organization Team Rocket
        who want to steal Ash's Pikachu and any other rare Pok√©mon they come
        across. Giovanni, Team Rocket's Boss introduced three new high-ranking
        members of Team Rocket; Cassidy, Butch, and Raticate, who want to kidnap
        Pok√©mon so they can use their moves. Ash wins eight badges from Gym
        Leaders in the Kanto region to compete in the Indigo Conference League.

      <h2>
        <u> <center>Gary Oak</center></u>
      </h2>
      <p class="desc">
        Gary Oak (Japanese: „Ç™„Éº„Ç≠„Éâ„Éª„Ç∑„Ç≤„É´ Shigeru Okido) is a recurring
        character who appeared in the Pok√©mon anime. He is a Pok√©mon Researcher
        from Pallet Town and grandson of Professor Oak. He is a childhood friend
        of Ash Ketchum and his main rival in the original series. In Pok√©mon
        Journeys: The Series, he serves as Goh's rival in Project Mew. His
        Japanese name is derived from Shigeru Miyamoto.Gary has been a neighbor
        of Ash Ketchum since they were both young. At one time, they seemed to
        be friends and went to see movies together, as seen in Lights, Camerupt,
        Action!. Shortly before beginning their journeys, Gary and Ash found an
        old Pok√© Ball while fishing. The two boys began fighting over who would
        get to keep the Pok√© Ball but ended up breaking it in half. Since then,
        they decided to keep the two separate pieces for themselves. It was
        revealed in The Ties That Bind that they still carried the pieces with
        them. <br />
        The day Gary started out on his Pok√©mon journey, he came off as an
        arrogant and egotistical Trainer. His chosen starter Pok√©mon was
        Squirtle, which was actually the same Pok√©mon that Ash originally wanted
        to start with, and he even had a group of cheerleaders who cheered him
        on in all of his battles, and they would go so far as crying whenever he
        lost. He didn't walk on his journeys like most Trainers did; instead he
        had his own sporty red convertible with a chauffeur. Gary loved when he
        got a chance to make fun of Ash by bragging about how far behind Ash was
        compared to him. He also gave Ash the pet-name of "Ashy-boy" (Japanese:
        "Satoshi-kun"), which occasionally seems to annoy him. His style of
        training at that point was to capture many Pok√©mon and to use the
        strongest, as a stark contrast to Ash, who was more focused on
        developing a bond with his Pok√©mon.
        <br />
        Gary made a brief appearance in Here Comes the Squirtle Squad, where he
        exited a town store, accidentally knocking Ash out in the process. In
        Mystery at the Lighthouse, Professor Oak revealed to Ash that Gary had
        already caught 45 Pok√©mon, compared to Ash's team of seven. Professor
        Oak also revealed that Gary's Pok√©mon included a much larger Krabby than
        the Krabby that Ash caught that episode. In Dig Those Diglett!, Gary was
        one of the Trainers who decided to help out the foreman in getting rid
        of the Diglett affecting construction at Gaiva Dam. Gary attempted to
        send out a Pok√©mon to battle the Diglett, but it did not exit the Pok√©
        Ball, and a Diglett returned it to him. He tried to send out his other
        Pok√©mon, though they also did not leave their Pok√© Balls and were
        returned to him by the Diglett. Realizing that his Pok√©mon did not want
        to battle the Diglett, he deemed it pointless to stay and left with his
        cheerleaders in their convertible.
